    <h1>How to Solve Today’s Letterboxed</h1>
    <p>The NYT Letterboxed puzzle is one of the hardest word puzzles designed and created by The New York Times team. At first when you open today's Letterboxed puzzle you can see 12 letters arranged on the four sides of a box. As a beginner with less knowledge in English vocabulary it's hard to solve but don't worry, we are here to help you. It is tricky but if you can follow this <a href="https://nytletterboxedsolver.com/">ultimate guide</a> you can connect words like a pro in no time.</p>

    <p>Let us solve this brainstorming word game in few steps:</p>

    <h2>Step 1: Understand the Rules (Again, Briefly)</h2>
    <p>First of all we need to know all the rules and always you need to keep in mind the final goal.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You must use all 12 letters at least once.</li>
      <li>You can’t use letters on the same side of the box back-to-back.</li>
      <li>You must form connected words where the last letter of one word is the first letter of the next.</li>
      <li>Aim to solve the puzzle in as few words as possible (ideally two or three).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Step 2: Start With Common Prefixes and Suffixes</h2>
    <p>Always try to begin the pattern with families pattern:<br>
    Prefixes: re, un, pre, sub<br>
    Suffixes: ing, ed, tion, ly<br>
    For example if you see letters like R, E, I, N, G then it can be Reign or Ringing. These are the basic clues you get to think how to start the word game.</p>

    <h2>Step 3: Build a Word Web</h2>
    <p>Now this is the step where actual brainstorming happens. Here you have to pick one letter which you can assume is a good starting point. Now look for another letter from a different side of the box which fits correctly. Try to form 4-6 letters in the beginning.</p>
    <p>Then ask yourself a few questions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Can I end that word with a letter that starts another one?</li>
      <li>Do I have any leftover letters after a few combos?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Now if you can find any meaningful ful word start with another letter and in minimal repeat you can find a meaningful words.</p>

    <h2>Step 4: Check If You’re Stuck? Backtrack and Break It Down</h2>
    <p>Sometimes you will be in the deadend where you can't form any meaningful words but don't lose hope. Now follow these steps:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Look at the unused letters. Are they awkward or rare ones like Q, X, or Z?</li>
      <li>Try plugging them into Scrabble-friendly word starters.</li>
      <li>Don’t be afraid to try a new starting point altogether.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Special tips to remember: if you have any word that has 5-7 letters it could give a better coverage.</p>

    <h2>Step 5: Don’t Skip the Second Word</h2>
    <p>Do you know many players find the first long word in the beginning but they could get stuck when they try to finish it with short words. Here if they focus in the second word they can easily close the loop and solve it more quickly.</p>
    <p>Special tip tip to remember: The golden key of this puzzle is to find the final letter of your first word. Try to think this way : What can start with that letter and use the remaining ones efficiently?</p>
